#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
-Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including  
communication, commerce, entertainment annd healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C): The inception of programming languages can be traced back to the early days of computing when machine code and assembly
languages ruled the realm. However, the need for more human-readable and efficient coding methods gave birth to first-generation languages like Fortran and COBOL in the 1950s. These
trailblazing languages not only expedited the programming process but also laid the foundation for the multifaceted evolution that was to follow.
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s: Software engineering emerged in the late 1960s as a new engineering discipline concerned with all aspects
pertaining to software production. It encompasses concepts, principles, theories, techniques and tools that can be used for developing high-quality professional software. First 
introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany, software engineering emphasizes a systematic, disciplined approach to software development and evolution 
and typically applies to the construction of large software systems (or products) in which teams of numerous software engineers are involved.
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s: The 1970s marked the beginning of the structured programming era. This was a significant milestone in the history of software 
engineering, as it introduced a new approach to writing software. Structured programming emphasises logical structures and procedures, making it easier to understand and debug software.
During this period, several high-level programming languages were developed, including C, Pascal, and Fortran. These languages made it possible to write more complex software, further 
driving the evolution of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing:  Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards functional requirements.
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Approach: Waterfall is linear and sequential. Agile is flexible and involves breaking down projects into smaller units called Sprints.
- Requirements: Waterfall is Well-defined and stable while Agile is evolving or unclear.
- Collaboration: Waterfall may be impractical with external vendors while in Agile, teamwork and collaboration are essential.
- Feedback: Waterfall has limited opportunities while Agile is flexible and allows changes to design, framework, requirements, and deliverables.
- Testing: Waterfall allows testing at the end of each phase while Agile allows testing at the end of each defined phase.
- Suitability: Waterfall has smaller, well-defined projects with limited customer involvement while Agile has large and complex projects with evolving requirements.
- Framework: Waterfall can be found in the following scenerios; Government software for public records, Construction of a new corporate office e.t.c. While Agile can be found in the 
following scenerios; Tech startup developing a mobile app, E-commerce website redesign, Marketing campaign for a new product e.t.c.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide com[rehensive tools to writing, debugging and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. examples are Girt, Subverson.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Software engineers encounter various challenges throughout the development process, including: Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines, Technical Debt. 
- Strategies for overcoming challenges include: Effective Communication, Agile Methodologies, Prioritization of Tasks and Regular Reassessment of Project Goals and Timelines.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Testing individual componenets or modules of software.
- Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different componenets or subsystems.
- System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
- Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is like creating a special recipe for your robot. A prompt tells the robot exactly what information you need it and how you want presented. 
- Prompt engineering is imporatnt in interacting with AI models because it guidescAI models to produce relevant and accurate outputs, and ensure effective human-AI interaction.
  
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Instead of this: Create a list of activities for young kids.
- Do this: Create a list of indoor activities for two kids ages 2 and 4, without them hurting themselves.
- The improved prompt is more effective beacause it is helping the AI model performance with more clear context and guidance, which can help mitigate bias and ambiguity in predictions.
